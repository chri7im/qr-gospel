<p>At the beginning, the Bible tells us, humanity lived in
perfect harmony with God, free from anxiety, fear, or shame. We knew who we
were because we knew whose we were. We were completely loved, entirely safe,
and fully at peace because we were completely known and accepted by God himself
(Genesis 1:26-31; Genesis 2:25).</p>
<br>
<p>But something went wrong. The first humans chose
independence from God, trusting themselves more than they trusted their Maker
(Genesis 3:1-7). With that rebellion came a catastrophic separation. Humanity
became disconnected from the very Source of life and peace. And ever since that
moment, deep within every human heart there has been an ache an anxious fear
that we're not enough, that we are ultimately alone, unloved, and vulnerable
(Genesis 3:8-10).</p>
<br>
<p>Your anxiety is not simply a chemical imbalance or a product
of your circumstances though those factors might make it worse but
fundamentally, anxiety comes from this deep, spiritual alienation: a profound
uncertainty about your value, your safety, your worth, and your future. Every
person carries this anxious heart condition because every human heart longs for
what was lost: perfect love, perfect acceptance, perfect security.</p>
<br>
<p>But here is the good news the Gospel itself:</p>
<br>
<p>God did not abandon us in our anxious state. He came looking
for us, and He has come to rescue us in Jesus Christ (Luke 19:10). Jesus一God
himself in human flesh一came to restore the broken relationship between God and
humanity. He lived the perfect life we could not live, completely trusting God,
free from anxiety and fear (Hebrews 4:15). But then, astonishingly, He went to
the cross. There, He willingly experienced ultimate separation, ultimate loss,
ultimate anxiety一the spiritual anguish of being abandoned一so that you and I
never have to (Mark 15:34; Isaiah 53:4-6).</p>
<br>
<p>On the cross, Jesus Christ paid the cost of your rebellion
and mine, absorbing our fears and failures. And when He rose from the dead, He
proved that death, sin, fear, and anxiety do not have the final word (1
Corinthians 15:54-57). His resurrection secured for us eternal, unshakable
peace with God (Romans 5:1).</p>
<br>
<p>If you put your trust in Jesus, your anxiety finds its only
lasting cure, because in Christ you receive a new identity: perfectly loved,
entirely forgiven, and permanently secure (Romans 8:38-39). The Gospel gives
you a love that doesn't depend on your performance, acceptance that doesn't
depend on your reputation, and a future that doesn't depend on your
circumstances. You are forever known, forever loved, forever safe in Him.</p>
<br>
<p>The Apostle Peter writes, <em>"Cast all your anxiety on Him
because He cares for you"</em> (1 Peter 5:7). The cure for anxiety is to know,
deeply and personally, that your Creator loves you enough to give His own Son
for you. Only when you rest fully in Christ's finished work, when the Gospel
saturates your heart and mind, will your anxious striving cease.</p>
<br>
<p>This ancient story of creation, fall, redemption, and
restoration speaks directly to your anxious heart. It invites you into a peace
far greater than mere emotional calm, a peace grounded in the unchangeable
reality of Jesus Christ's love. It is the only true, deep, lasting remedy for
the root of your anxiety.</p>
<br>
<p>Come to Jesus. In Him alone, your anxious heart can finally,
fully rest.</p>
