<p>In the beginning, we were created by God for perfect peace.
Humanity lived in complete harmony with our Creator, free from anxiety, fear,
or panic. Life was safe and secure because we were constantly connected to the
infinite, loving presence of God Himself. We knew who we were because we knew
who He was our good and trustworthy Father (Genesis 1:26-31; 2:7-25).</p>
<br>
<p>But then something tragic happened. Humanity believed a
terrible lie: that we would be happier and more secure apart from God. We chose
independence, grasping for control of our lives, and as a result, became
disconnected from the very source of peace and security (Genesis 3:1-7). From
that moment on, our hearts experienced something they were never created to
handleä¸€deep, existential fear, insecurity, and panic. We now live in a broken
world filled with uncertainty, and our hearts, disconnected from the security
of God s presence, panic in the face of threats and uncertainty. That profound
spiritual disconnection is the root cause of your panic attacks.</p>
<br>
<p>Your panic attacks aren't simply a physiological or
psychological condition though they manifest there. At their deepest level,
they are your soul s desperate cry for the perfect security and control that
humanity lost long ago in the Garden.</p>
<br>
<p>But there is good news the greatest news possible:</p>
<br>
<p>God didn't leave you trapped in your panic and fear. He
stepped into our fearful world Himself. Jesus Christ, God in human flesh,
entered directly into the chaos, uncertainty, and terror of our broken world
(John 1:14). He walked among us, experiencing firsthand the fears, worries, and
uncertainties we all face. Jesus, in the Garden of Gethsemane, experienced a
kind of cosmic panic attack, facing unimaginable dread about the horror
awaiting Him on the cross. He cried out, sweating blood, pleading with His Father:
<em>"My soul is overwhelmed with sorrow to the point of death"</em> (Matthew
26:38). And on the cross, Jesus experienced the ultimate terror, abandonment,
and loss of control, as He cried, <em>"My God, my God, why have you forsaken
me?"</em> (Matthew 27:46).</p>
<br>
<p>Jesus willingly faced that ultimate panic the terror of
cosmic separation from God so that you would never have to experience the
ultimate panic of facing existence alone. When Jesus rose from the dead, He
proved definitively that the chaos and uncertainty of this world do not have
the last word (1 Corinthians 15:55-57). His resurrection declares to you and
the entire universe that, in Him, all threats, uncertainties, and fears have
been ultimately overcome.</p>
<br>
<p>When you trust in Jesus and His finished work on the cross,
something incredible happens: You are reunited to God Himself. You enter into a
relationship of unshakeable peace and infinite security. Jesus promises,
<em>"Peace I leave with you; my peace I give to you... Do not let your hearts
be troubled and do not be afraid"</em> (John 14:27). In Christ, you are deeply
known, infinitely loved, and eternally secure, no matter what circumstances
come your way (Romans 8:38-39).</p>
<br>
<p>The Gospel is the only real, lasting cure for your panic
attacks because it addresses your soul's deepest fear the fear of ultimate
abandonment, loss of control, and death. In Jesus Christ, the Creator of the
universe knows you, loves you, and holds you securely forever. Your panic
attacks lose their power when your heart fully grasps that you are completely
safe and secure in Him.</p>
<br>
<p>Come to Jesus, the One who knows intimately your fear and
panic, who willingly endured the ultimate panic for you, and who alone can
truly offer peace that the world cannot take away. In Christ alone, your soul
can finally rest in perfect, unshakable peace.</p>
