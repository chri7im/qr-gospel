<p>At the very beginning, the Bible tells us humanity lived in
perfect harmony with God. Our hearts were fully alive, satisfied by His
presence and deeply connected to meaning, joy, and purpose. We were designed
for infinite beauty, infinite love, and infinite significance because we were
made to know God intimately (Genesis 1:26-31).</p>
<br>
<p>But something went tragically wrong. We chose to seek life
apart from God, believing we could find satisfaction and meaning without Him
(Genesis 3:1-6). This rebellion disconnected us from the very source of life,
plunging humanity into spiritual darkness and emptiness. Now, we find ourselves
in a world deeply broken, longing desperately for meaning, worth, and hope, but
unable to fully grasp them on our own. This spiritual disconnection is the root
of depression. It leaves us feeling lost, hopeless, empty, and alone.</p>
<br>
<p>Depression, at its deepest level, is a symptom of the soul's
separation from the One it was created for. It whispers the painful lie that
life has no purpose, no hope, and no beauty. But that ancient story doesn't end
there.</p>
<br>
<p>The good news一the Gospel一is that God refused to leave us in
our despair. He came into our world Himself in the person of Jesus Christ,
entering into our pain, sorrow, and darkness to rescue us (John 1:14). Jesus
didn't merely sympathize from afar一He felt the full weight of sorrow,
isolation, and abandonment. The prophet Isaiah called Him <em>"a man of
sorrows, acquainted with grief"</em> (Isaiah 53:3). On the cross, Jesus
experienced the ultimate darkness一cosmic abandonment, isolation, and
despair一when He cried, <em>"My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?"</em>
(Matthew 27:46). He endured this ultimate despair so that you and I would never
have to be alone or without hope again.</p>
<br>
<p>But the story still wasn't over. Three days later, Jesus
rose from the dead, defeating the power of darkness and despair forever (1
Corinthians 15:3-4). His resurrection means that hopelessness and despair don't
get the final say in your life. Jesus conquered death itself, promising a new
life filled with purpose, meaning, and eternal hope to everyone who trusts in
Him.</p>
<br>
<p>If you believe and trust in what Jesus has done for you,
your life is forever changed. Through faith, you are united to Christ. Your
identity is transformed from emptiness and despair to being deeply loved,
eternally secure, and fully accepted by the Creator of the universe. This
radical acceptance doesn't depend on your strength, your feelings, or your
performance一it's a free gift of God's grace (Ephesians 2:8-9).</p>
<br>
<p>This gospel is the only real and lasting cure for depression
because it restores your heart's deepest need: the love, acceptance, and
purpose that only God Himself can provide. The gospel says you are infinitely
valuable because the Son of God gave His life for you. It promises your
suffering is never meaningless or final because the risen Christ promises He
will restore and redeem all brokenness (Revelation 21:4).</p>
<br>
<p>In Christ alone, you can find lasting hope一a hope grounded
not in wishful thinking but in the historical reality of His resurrection and
victory over darkness. Because of Him, even your darkest moments have purpose,
and even your deepest sorrow is overshadowed by eternal joy.</p>
<br>
<p>Come to Jesus, the One who knows your depression intimately,
the One who bore it on Himself, and the One who alone can fully restore your
soul. In Him, and only in Him, your soul can finally find lasting rest, hope,
and true healing.</p>
