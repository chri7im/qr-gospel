<p>At the very beginning, the Bible says humanity was created
by God, in His image, to reflect His glory, enjoy His presence, and fulfill a
beautiful, meaningful purpose一to steward and cultivate creation in harmony with
Him (Genesis 1:26-28; 2:15). Our lives were designed to have profound
significance because we were directly connected to God, the source of all
meaning and purpose.</p>
<br>
<p>But then something terrible happened. Humanity chose to seek
meaning and purpose apart from God, believing the lie that independence from
our Creator would give us greater significance (Genesis 3:1-7). Instead, this
rebellion disconnected us from the very source of purpose, plunging humanity
into existential emptiness. Since then, we've struggled with a sense of
futility, restlessness, and a nagging emptiness, wondering why we're here, what
we should be doing, and whether anything really matters (Ecclesiastes 1:2-11).</p>
<br>
<p>Your sense of purposelessness isn't simply about your
career, your circumstances, or your dreams falling short一it's a symptom of
being disconnected from the God who created you for Himself. The human heart
will always feel empty and aimless until it is reconnected to the One for whom
it was made.</p>
<br>
<p>But here is the Gospel一the breathtaking good news:</p>
<br>
<p>God did not leave us lost, purposeless, and disconnected.
Instead, He stepped into history Himself in the person of Jesus Christ (John
1:14). Jesus lived the life of perfect purpose and obedience that you and I
fail to live. Everything He did was perfectly aligned with His Father's plan
(John 5:19), and He willingly went to the cross to heal our brokenness, forgive
our rebellion, and restore us to the ultimate purpose we had lost.</p>
<br>
<p>On the cross, Jesus Christ faced the ultimate futility一the
cosmic emptiness and purposelessness of bearing our sin and being separated
from His Father一crying out, <em>"My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?"</em>
(Matthew 27:46). He experienced that cosmic loss of meaning so that you and I
could be restored to the infinite purpose of knowing, loving, and enjoying God
forever.</p>
<br>
<p>When Jesus rose from the dead, He proved once and for all
that despair, emptiness, and purposelessness don't have the final word (1
Corinthians 15:20-22). His resurrection means that through faith in Him, your
life is no longer random or meaningless; you are united to a grand story, the
greatest story of redemption, renewal, and restoration ever told.</p>
<br>
<p>When you trust Jesus Christ, your heart is reconnected to
the One who created you for Himself. You receive a new identity: you're no
longer defined by what you achieve, what people think of you, or how successful
you are. Instead, you are infinitely loved, completely forgiven, and eternally
secure in Christ. Your ultimate purpose becomes living for the glory and joy of
knowing Him intimately and sharing that life-giving love with others (2
Corinthians 5:17-21).</p>
<br>
<p>Only the Gospel fully cures your lack of purpose because it
connects your life to God's eternal plan and gives your life a significance
that nothing else ever can. Every ordinary thing you do一your work, your
relationships, your decisions一now becomes deeply meaningful because you're
living for something infinitely greater than yourself (Colossians 3:23-24).</p>
<br>
<p>Come to Jesus, the One who willingly endured ultimate
emptiness and purposelessness on your behalf, and who alone offers the ultimate
meaning your heart craves. In Him alone, your soul will finally find the full,
lasting, glorious purpose it was made for.</p>
